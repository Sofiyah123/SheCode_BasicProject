          Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other
          ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were
          modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of
          preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which share features
          with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies. The
          most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as
          butter, oil or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as
          baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include
          dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts.
